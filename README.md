# Pyber-Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine what the weekly fare amounts are for the three different city types - urban, suburban, and rural - using matplotlib to visualize the data in an appealing and meaningful way. Additionally, it aims to determine other important statistics to determine the differences between urban, suburban, and rural ride shares.
## Results

This data shows a pretty obvious negative correlation between the total rides/total drivers and average fare per ride/driver. This just means that, based on the population of the city, the ride share prices are higher in rural places (population is low) and ride share prices are lower in urban areas (population is high). This could be for a variety of reasons. There is likely a shorter distance to drive in urban areas in comparison to rural areas. It's also possible that there are additional fees added onto a ride where the driver has to drive a significant amount of miles away in order to pick up/drop off a passenger in rural areas as opposed to urban areas. Supply and demand also likely play a role in this as well.

The graph indicates that most of the revenue generated for PyBer is in urban areas while rural areas have the least revenue generated. This indicates that, while the profit margins may be higher in suburban and rural areas, the sheer volume of demand in urban areas are driving profits.
## Summary
To pull more revenue from suburban and rural areas, it might be beneficial to provide monetary incentives to drivers who drive in those areas. It might also be beneficial to reduce prices during low volume times in order to incentivize riders to go out more during those times. It is also important to ensure all markets are advertized to in ways that produce more revenue, while also ensuring the safety of drivers and riders alike.
